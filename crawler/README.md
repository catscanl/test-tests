# Test
I'd like you to write a simple web crawler in a language of your choice. It should be limited to one domain - so when crawling insertname.com it would crawl all pages within the domain, but not follow the links to the Facebook and Twitter accounts. Given a URL, it should output a site map, showing which static assets each page depends on, and the links between pages. 

Ideally, write it as you would a production piece of code. Bonus points for tests & making it as fast as possible! Don't spend too long on it - it should probably take you a couple of hours.
